    RENAMED the "_" directory as the "assets" directory, for easier integration to various CMS and blog engines
    UPDATED Font Awesome to 4.2.0

    NEW build/styles directory for segregation of LESS and SCSS files
    UPDATE Font Awesome (4.1.0)
    UPDATE Boostrap (3.2.0)
    REMOVED Bootstrap CSS files in favor of the LESS and SCSS counterparts (include or exclude features via comment)
    REMOVED Font Awesome CSS files in favor of the LESS and SCSS counterparts (include or exclude features via comment)
    UPDATE to libraries(less/scss) files to include the appropriate Bootstrap and Font Awesome files
    UPDATES to gitignore
    REMOVED /tests directory, as it was outside of the scope of this project. You should test your code, but I leave it up to you.

05.12.14 v2.0.1:
    UPDATE to footer.kit (and index.html by proxy) for new Google Analytics Universal Properties script
    UPDATE to app.js for the overall App variable, which now references a "ga" analytics element

    UPDATE jQuery to 2.1.1

04.23.14 v2.0.0:
    MERGED the Codekit Kickoff SASS Branch - Now both the app.less and app.scss files compile out to app.css. You choose what you prefer to use. Default is LESS.
    ADDED index.html in the root path of the project, which mirrors the app/index.html file, so that you can use CodeKit's "Preview" button

    UPDATED header.kit to reflect the new app.css file reference
    UPDATED app.js to remove JSLINT preferences on previous Line 5, in favor of managing that preference within CodeKit.
